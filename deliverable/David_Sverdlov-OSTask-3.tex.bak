\section{Introduction}

This deliverable documents the different steps taken in the project for the course Capita Selecta of Software Engineering, taught by Maja D'Hondt at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. The goal of the project is to improve an existing program by means of automated unit testing and refactoring. The project is individual unless a team of 2 people has been approved. The chosen project is the Android application 'AMuRate', which was a part of my bachelor's project. This has been proposed and approved in one of the first lectures and will be first be described before moving on to the different steps of this project.
